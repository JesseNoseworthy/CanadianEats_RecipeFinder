#Canadian Eats Recipe Finder

This website was designed and developed as part of HackerYou's Front-End Website Development bootcamp. Within it I've utilized HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, jQuery and Ajax. 

The purpose of the website is to allow for users to search from a variety of Canadian ingredients, choosing to either pick one choice or multiple choices.

The website is also hosted on <a target="_blank" href="CanadainEats.co">my portfolio website</a>.
